# Predictive Modeling with Simulation Algorithms for Celestial Systems

*A simulation framework employing advanced numerical integration methods to predict the behavior of complex, interacting systems.*

## Overview

This project implements advanced numerical integration schemes to simulate complex N-body systems. Originally developed for studying 1D and novel 2D Hamiltonian Mean Field (HMF) models, the framework has been re-engineered into a modular simulation platform. It bridges rigorous algorithm development with modern predictive modeling—showcasing techniques analogous to those used in data science and software engineering.

## Key Features

- **Algorithm Innovation:**  
  - Implements a second-order Runge–Kutta method for 1D simulations.
